Description: Provides functions for creating, modifying, and displaying bitmaps including printing them in the terminal.   There is a special emphasis on monochrome bitmap fonts and their glyphs as well as colored pixel art/sprites.  Provides native read/write support for the 'hex' and 'yaff' bitmap font formats and if 'monobit' <https://github.com/robhagemans/monobit> is installed can also read/write several additional bitmap font formats.
